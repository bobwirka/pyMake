PYMAKE(1)                                      User Commands                                      PYMAKE(1)

NAME
       pyMake - Compile and build an application as specified in an XML configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       pyMake.py [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       pyMake is a command-line tool designed to automate the process of compiling and building projects
       according to the specifications defined in an XML configuration file. It supports variable 
       substitutions, conditional processing, prebuild and postbuild operations, and recursive project 
       builds.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Display the version of pyMake and exit.

       -c, --clean
              Clean the build directories before starting the build process.

       -p, --prebuild
              Execute recursive pyMake on prebuild projects before building the main project.

       -f, --file CONFIG_FILE
              Specify the XML configuration file to use for the build. Default is 'pyMake.xml'.

       -g, --cfg CONFIG
              Specify the build configuration to use as defined in the XML file. Default is 'Release'.

       -o, --one FILE
              Compile only the specified source file. No linking or artifact creation is performed.

       -s, --sub KEY:VALUE
              Specify variable substitutions as key-value pairs. This option can be repeated to provide 
              multiple substitutions.

       -i, --inc INCLUDE_FILE
              Include additional XML <dicts> files for variable substitution before processing the main 
              configuration file. This option can be repeated for multiple files.

       -x, --xml
              Print intermediate XML files generated during processing. Useful for debugging and 
              troubleshooting the build process.

FILES
       pyMake.xml
              The default XML configuration file specifying the project's build structure, settings, and 
              dependencies.

       *.d
              Dependency files generated during the compilation process, used for tracking source file 
              modifications.

       *.mtime
              Timestamp files used to determine if source files have changed since the last build.

EXIT STATUS
       0      The build completed successfully.

       1      An error occurred during the build process.

EXAMPLES
       Compile and build the project using the default 'pyMake.xml' file and 'Release' configuration:

              pyMake.py

       Clean the build directories before building:

              pyMake.py --clean

       Use a specific configuration file and build configuration:

              pyMake.py --file myConfig.xml --cfg Debug

       Perform a prebuild operation on dependent projects before building:

              pyMake.py --prebuild

       Compile a single source file without linking:

              pyMake.py --one main.c

       Apply variable substitutions and include additional XML files:

              pyMake.py --sub target:x86 --sub build:fast --inc extraDicts.xml

NOTES
       The XML configuration file is parsed and processed in multiple stages:
       - Initial parsing and inclusion of specified <dicts> files.
       - Evaluation and substitution of variables.
       - Conditional processing based on 'if' attributes.
       - Recursive builds and execution of prebuild operations.
       - Compilation, linking, and postbuild operations.

       The 'if' attribute in the XML allows conditional inclusion or exclusion of elements based on 
       variable values and logical expressions.
